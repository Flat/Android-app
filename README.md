# Features

## BEING THE BEST RADIO APP YOUR WEEABOO EARS WILL EVER NEED. EVERY OTHER APP SUCKS, WANNA KNOW WHY? IT ISN'T THIS ONE. THE MOMENT THIS APPLICATION IS INSTALLED ON YOUR MOBILE DEVCE A STREAM OF LIGHT WILL BEAM DOWN FROM THE SKY AND ENVELOPE THE VICINITY OF A 3200 METER RADIUS. YOU BEGIN TO HEAR A SMALL RUMBLING THAT GRADUALLY BECOMES A DEAFENING ROAR SO LOUD THE GROUND BEGINS TO SHAKE AND CRACK. BUILDINGS AROUND YOU ARE REDUCED TO PILES OF RUBBLE AS THE EARTH SPLITS OPEN TO REVEAL A GIANORMOUS CHASM THAT EXCEEDS THE LENGTH, WIDTH, AND HEIGHT OF MOUNT EVEREST. YOU WATCH LAVA BUBBLING OUT FROM THE CHASM WHILE THE LARGEST STAGE YOU HAVE EVER SEEN SLOWLY EMERGES, COMPLETELY DECKED OUT WITH THE GREATEST SPEAKERS KNOWN TO MAN. THUDDING SOUNDS BEGIN ECHOING TOWARDS YOUR DIRECTION IN THE FAR OFF DISTANCE. SUDDENLY YOU ARE STARTLED BY A SOFT PAT ON YOUR LEFT SHOULDER. YOU QUICKLY TURN AROUND TO SEE A GODDAMN BEAR STARING YOU DOWN WITH PITCH BLACK EYES. HOW DID IT GET THERE?! THE BEAR SLOWLY LIFTS ITS RIGHT PAW UP AND MAKES A GESTURING MOTION TO YOUR MOBILE DEVICE. YOU LOOK DOWN AT THE SCREEN DISPLAYING A SINGLE SENTENCE: "IT IS TIME". IMMEDIATELY ALL THUDDING NOISES CEASE AND THERE IS A COMPLETE SILENCE. LOOKING BACK UP AT THE BEAR, YOU COULD HAVE SWORN YOU SAW A TWINKLE IN ITS EYE. IT ONCE AGAIN SLOWLY LIFTS ITS RIGHT PAW UP AND GESTURES TO LOOK BEHIND YOU. YOU QUICKLY TURN AROUND AND HUNDREDS---THOUSANDS---NO... MILLIONS! YOU SEE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LOUNGING AROUND ON THE STAGE JUST IN FRONT OF YOU. WHO THE HELL ARE THESE PEOPLE?! HOW DID THEY ALL GET HERE?! YOUR MOBILE DEVICE STARTS VIBRATING SO VIOLENTLY YOU CAN BARELY KEEP IT IN YOUR HANDS. A SINGLE PLAY BUTTON TAKING UP THE ENTIRE SCREEN HAS APPEARED. YOU GLANCE BACK AT THE BEAR AND IT LOOKS AT YOU FOR A MOMENT BEFORE GIVING A SINGLE NOD. THERE IS ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO AND YOU PRESS THE BUTTON ON YOUR MOBILE DEVICE. THE SPEAKERS ON THE STAGE BEGIN TO EMIT A STEADY HUM WHILE THEY POWER UP. BEAMS OF LIGHT IN RANDOM COLORS, FLASHING AT RANDOM INTERVALS, COME STREAMING DOWN FROM THE SKY ON TO THE STAGE. AS YOU START MAKING YOUR WAY TOWARDS THE STAGE, THE SPEAKERS BEGIN RESONATING THUNDEROUSLY WHILE GENERATING SMALL EARTHQUAKES. "I THINK IT'S TIME WE BLOW THIS SCENE---". BEFORE YOU START CLIMBING ONTO THE STAGE SOMEONE OFFERS YOU THEIR HAND. "GET EVERYBODY AND THE STUFF TOGETHER...". YOU FIRMLY GRASP THE HAND OFFERED. "OKAY, THREE, TWO, ONE---". AND GET PULLED UP ONTO THE STAGE. "LET'S JAM".
